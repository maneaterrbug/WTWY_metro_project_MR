### Project Proposal Template

Before you start project work for a course, you **should be able to complete the following proposal template**, addressing the questions listed as completely as possible. 
However, keep in mind that throughout the design iterations of your project, many parts of it will likely change 
(i.e. increase/decrease in number of samples, types of features or algorithm used, etc), so this is just a starting point.
Also, if you are unsure in some areas, you should still submit a partial proposal to receive feedback from instructors. 

In addition to submitting this plan, you may discuss the areas below with an instructor in a **scope meeting**.

#### Question/need:
* What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build? 
Using data available to us (primarily NY Metro Turnstile data), how can the WTWY organization more strategically target subway stations with their street teams to both spread more awareness AND attract summer gala attendees?
* Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system? 
An obvious answer here is the WTWY organization as a beneficiary, as with improved data they can more successfully attract new interest/participants in the organization and raise more funding at the gala. Also, depending on how successfully we are able to target demographics using the datam, another potential beneficiary would be women from marginalized areas or groups who may not traditionally have access to the resources or information necessary to enter the tech world. 

#### Data Description:
* What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data? NY Metro turnstile data, NYC census data, the data will be gathered using a combination of SQL, and the python library sqlalchem
* What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with? 
* If modeling, what will you predict as your target?

#### Tools:
* How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project? 
* Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?

#### MVP Goal:
* What would a [minimum viable product (MVP)](./mvp.md) look like for this project?
