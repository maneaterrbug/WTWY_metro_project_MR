### Project Proposal
 

#### Question/need:
* What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build? 
	* Using data available to us (primarily NY Metro Turnstile data), how can the WTWY organization more strategically target subway stations with their street teams to both spread more awareness AND attract summer gala attendees?
* Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system? 
	* An obvious answer here is the WTWY organization as a beneficiary, as with improved data they can more successfully attract new interest/participants in the organization and raise more funding at the gala. Also, depending on how successfully we are able to target demographics using the datam, another potential beneficiary would be women from marginalized areas or groups who may not traditionally have access to the resources or information necessary to enter the tech world. 

#### Data Description:
* What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data? 
	* NY Metro turnstile data, NYC census data. The data has either already been provided to us (turnstile data) or already exists and can be obtained by some brief google searching. 
* What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with? 
* If modeling, what will you predict as your target?

#### Tools:
* How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project? 
	* The data will be gathered using a combination of SQL, and the python library sqlalchem. In addition, matplotlib will be used to visualize the data so it is easily palatable by end-users.
* Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?
	* At this time no, I believe all tools available to us in the course/described here should be sufficient to deliver an MVP.

#### MVP Goal:
* What would a [minimum viable product (MVP)](./mvp.md) look like for this project?
	* A minimum viable product for this project would be some kind of visualization(s) detailing the most trafficked stations/neighborhoods and the most trafficked times describing the findings. In addition, there should be a brief description of the work done and the means used to accomplish said work, with a more in depth explanation of what the findings mean for the organization (ie predictions about future travel, recommendations for street team station placement). A potential product that is more finalized would use additional datasets (in this case the census data described above) to make more targeted/informed decisions regarding street team planning.
