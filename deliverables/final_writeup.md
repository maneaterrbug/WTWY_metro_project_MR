**Abstract:**

In this project, we are tasked with helping the non-profit organization, WomanTechWomanYes (WTWY), both maximize attendance to their annual summer fundraising gala and spread awareness of their cause by using data analytics methods to ***optimize their resources WTWY plans to post street teams at the entrances to subway stations ***. In order to aid WTWY in strategically scheduling their street teams to maximize engagement, we turned to New York City subway ridership [records](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) and US census data to provide insight into both the most heavily trafficked stations, as well as the stations in areas with residents most likely/able to donate.
