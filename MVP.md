## Analysis of MTA Turnstile Data for WTWY

In this project, we are approached by a nonprofit organization seeking our data  science expertise to aid them in an upcoming fundraising event they will be hosting. WomanTechWomanYes are looking to use NYC MTA turnstile data (as found on http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) to better inform their street team subway station placement to both attract as many potential WTWY Annual Summer Gala attendees as possible and raise awareness to the public of their important mission.

We chose to approach this problem by looking at 4 months of MTA data preceding the gala (02/06/2021 - 05/29/2021) and attempting to determine the most trafficked stations in NYC, those stations' traffic trends through the chosen window of time, and a breakdown of total entries by the day of the week.
